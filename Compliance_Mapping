SIMP SCTM
=========

This SCTM was developed based on the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Specical Publication 800-53 (Revision 3) controls that
SIMP currently meets. Empty contents means SIMP does not meet that
control. Implementations are free to take these tables and use them as a
starting point for any accreditation activities that follow NIST 800-53.

     - Inactive local accounts expire 35 days after password expiration. LDAP accounts can be set to expire in LDAP and using PAM. There is no automated method (included with SIMP) to check inactive LDAP accounts. Implementations should address inactive LDAP accounts with automated or administrative measures.
   * - AC-2(4)
     - Account Management (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - Local account creation is audited with auditd. (as are all of root's actions). Sudosh logs all commands for someone running sudosh. This will not work if the SIMP implementation uses specific sudo rules. Instead, sudo actions are logged using auditd. Ldap modifications are logged in the ldap logs.

     - Access Control
     - IPTables enforces flow control to the puppet master and clients. The default rules allow the services needed for kick start and puppet (and SSH of course). IPTables is managed by puppet so that any user modifications to /etc/sysconfig/iptables is rewritten with the rules from the manifest. The rules can and should be tailored per implementation.

     - Least Privilege
     - Access Control
     - SIMP was built using a minimalist approach. Only the services, applications (RPMs and their dependencies), and network rules that are needed are implemented. Adding additional services, users, or software are done using built in RedHat/CentOS features or puppet. For example, services cannot be manually added without first registering them with puppet.
   * - AC-6(1)
     - Least Privilege (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - File permissions and administrative functions are denied to users who are not administrators using Unix DAC. Roles can be defined by a implementation. Typically it's done using ldap groups and sudosh. Suoders rules can be set for roles that need a limited set of commands/functions.
   * - AC-6(2)
     - Least Privilege (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - Direct remote root login is not allowed on SIMP. Users must assume their role first (defined in LDAP or locally). There is a local simp user on the puppet master that has a password assigned. That allows for emergency maintenance via SSH. Single user mode is password protected, but will allow direct access before escalation. Protection of the single user mode and simp user's password is up to the implementation. Privilege escalation is performed using sudosh or sudo. Most implementations will use sudosh for global admins and sudo for roles that need minimal admin ability. Lastly, serial port access is does allow direct root login (/etc/securetty). Implementations may further restrict this at the risk.

     - Unsuccessful Login Attempts
     - Access Control
     - SIMP locks accounts after 5 invalid attempts over 15 minutes span. It then keeps the account locked for 15 minutes. After that, the account is unlocked automatically.
   * - AC-7(1)
     - Unsuccessful Login Attempts (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - An account is never locked to a point an admin must unlock it. It will continue to be unlocked after 15 minutes. This should meet most modern policies. It can be further restricted if required by local policies.
   * - AC-7(2)
     - Unsuccessful Login Attempts (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - 
   * - AC-8
     - System Use Notification
     - Access Control
     - SIMP displays a default banner prior to login. Implementations must customize that banner for their use.
   * - AC-9
     - Previous Logon (Access) Notification
     - Access Control
     - SIMP uses the pam\_lastlog.so module to display last login information.
   * - AC-9(1)
     - Previous Logon (Access) Notification (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - SIMP uses the pam\_lastlog.so module to display last login information.
   * - AC-9(2)
     - Previous Logon (Access) Notification (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - SIMP uses the pam\_lastlog.so module to display last login information, including the number of failed login attempts since the last logon.
   * - AC-9(3)
     - Previous Logon (Access) Notification (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - 
   * - AC-10
     - Concurrent Session Control
     - Access Control
     - The default value for concurrent sessions in SIMP is 10 (/etc/security/limits.conf). Given the variety of system usage to include automated processes, it could impact functionality if this value were set lower. It can be tailored to a lower value if the implementation determines that number will not impact functionality.
   * - AC-11
     - Session Lock
     - Access Control
     - Terminal sessions do not enforce a session lock so this control is technically not implemented. However, it's mitigated by forcing inactive sessions to log out. If the gnome module is applied, SIMP locks a gnome session after 5 minutes.
   * - AC-14
     - Permitted Actions without Identification or Authentication
     - Access Control
     - SIMP provides several services that do not require authentication. Most require some form of identification. These are documented in the SIMP Security Concepts and is kept current for that version. Individual modules are not yet documented.
   * - AC-14(1)
     - Permitted Actions without Identification or Authentication (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - Justifications to those services that do not require Identification and Authentication can be found in the SIMP Security Concepts document.
   * - AC-16
     - Security Attributes
     - Access Control
     - New in SIMP 5.0 is the usage of MAC via SELinux. This is optional for each implementation and can be turned off at any time. All of the stock SIMP modules work with SELinux enabled and have the least restrictive MAC policies enforced. These policies assign each object a SELinux user, role, type, and level. These characteristics are used to define a context for each object.

     - Access Control
     - 
   * - AC-17
     - Remote Access
     - 
     - By default, external connections are not allowed with the exception of SSH. This is documented in the SIMP user manual. Implementations have the ability to override this with the understanding that puppet controls Iptables.
   * - AC-17(1)
     - Remote Access (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - The extent of monitoring remote connections is done by auditd and syslog. The contents of the remote session is not logged. The keystrokes of users with sudosh shells are all logged.
   * - AC-17(2)
     - Remote Access (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - Remote access is limited to SSH. SSH (openssh on centos/rhel) provides both confidentiality and integrity of the remote session.
   * - AC-17(3)
     - Remote Access (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - 
   * - AC-17(4)
     - Remote Access (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - This control is enforced via other access control mechanisms already covered in 800-53. Namely, AC-6. By default, SSH in SIMP will allow anyone to connect. Once identification and authentication is performed, access control to privileged commands is enforced as usual.
   * - AC-17(5)
     - Remote Access (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - Auditd provides logging of failed access attempts. It's up to the implementation to perform a level of inspection of these unauthorized events. Auditd does this by default. Other checks will ensure auditd is running and registered with puppet.
   * - AC-17(6)

     - Remote Access (Control Enhancement)
     - Access Control
     - This control is only met by defining all connections that SIMP allows internally and externally. For now, since this is a remote access control, it should suffice to continue to note that the only remote access protocol allowed by default is SSH.

     - Auditable Events
     - Audit and Accountability
     - a. SIMP audit rules were built by using idustry best practices gathered over the years. The heaviest reliance has been on the SCAP-Security Guide (SSG). SIMP aims for a balance between performance and operational needs so the settings are rarely an exact match from these guides. The list of events that audited are by auditd can be found in appendix of the Security Concepts document. b. Implementation Specific c. Rational is for audit setting is provided in SSG. d. Threat information is specific to the implementation. Auditd and syslog facility can always be fine tuned for each implementation.
   * - AU-2(3)
     - Auditable Events (Control Enhancement)
     - Audit and Accountability
     - SIMP is constantly reviewing the audit rules for accuracy, relevance, and performance. Rules are added and in some cases removed as information becomes available.
   * - AU-2(4)
     - Auditable Events (Control Enhancement)
     - Audit and Accountability
     - Privileged user commands are logged using sudosh and auditd (sudo actions). By default, users in the administrators group can run sudosh. All of the key strokes (except things that are not echoed back to the screen like passwords) are logged to /var/log/sudosh.log and can be sent to syslog. If an implementation sets up specific sudo actions for other groups or users, those actions are logged with auditd.
   * - AU-3
     - Content of Audit Records
     - Audit and Accountability
     - The linux audit daemon contains event type, date/time, host, and outcome of events by default.
   * - AU-3(1)
     - Content of Audit Records (Control Enhancement)
     - Audit and Accountability
     - There are a number of events that are captured beyond the auditd. The SIMP syslog module captures additional log events from apache, ldap, puppet, messages.log, and secure.log.
   * - AU-3(2)
     - Content of Audit Records (Control Enhancement)
     - Audit and Accountability
     - By default, the SIMP syslog module logs locally. There is an option to send the syslog events to a central location. Instructions for implementing a syslog server are provided in the User Guide. Lastly, a combination of elasticsearch, logstash, and kibana (ELK) can be applied to filter, index, and search logs. Puppet modules are provided for the ELK stack
   * - AU-4
     - Audit Storage Capacity
     - Audit and Accountability
     - The audit partition is configured as a separation partition from the system files, reducing the likelihood of audit interfering with system operations. Implementaions can change this but it's highly discouraged.
   * - AU-5
     - Response to Audit Processing Failures
     - Audit and Accountability
     - a. Implementation Specific. b. The audit.conf file configures the system to log to syslog when disk space becomes low. If the disk becomes full, the audit daemon will be suspended, but the system will remain active. This is contrary to some industry guidance to put the system into single user mode when disk space becomes an issue. Implementations may wish to change the default behaviour at the risk of stopping the system from functioning.
   * - AU-5(1)
     - Response to Audit Processing Failures (Control Enhancement)
     - Audit and Accountability
     - SIMP provides a warning (to syslog) when the disk has 75MB free. Each log file can be up to 30MB.

     - Audit Reduction and Report Generation (Control Enhancement)
     - Audit and Accountability
     - While not true audit reduction, RedHat does allow someone with access to audit logs to perform filters using the journald. If audit logs are forwarded to a syslog server, it's not difficult for an admin to security officer to run batch filters against all of the audit records. As of SIMP 4.0.5, an optional Logstash, Kibana, and Elasticsearch modules can be applied. If applied, they provide centralized and indexed logs. An implementation can then perform searches against the logs or provide alerts to other parts of their infrastructure.

     - C. Authenticator strength is enforced using pam\_crack\_lib.so. This works for user defined passwords on local and LDAP accounts. E. It's up to the implementation to change the values for the various passwords. F. Password history is set to 24 by default in SIMP and enforced with pam.G. For local accounts, password aging is set to 180 days. It's set to the same in LDAP, but enforced at the time of account creation using ldifs. LDAP subsequently uses PAM to enforce the aging. Key based passwordless logins do not enforce aging. Upon generation, server and puppet certificates can also be set to expire.H. Authenticators for local and LDAP account are protected using operating system access controls. The server certificates are also protected using operating system controls.

     - a. Authenticator strength is enforced using pam\_crack\_lib.so. This works for user defined passwords on local and LDAP accounts. Administrators can bypass PAM and set weak passwords in LDAP. Under normal circumstances, users would be forced to change their password at login, at which point pam enforced complexity. b. Not enforced c. Hashed passwords are built into linux (/etc/shadow and /etc/pam.d/system-auth pam\_unix.so). LDAP password changed by users are done through pam before getting placed in LDAP. Manual LDAP password are created using the slapasswd command.d. Password minimum and maximum lifetimes are enforced through /etc/login.defs and ldap. e. By default, the previous 24 passwords can not be reused.

     - SIMP has strictly enforced version control during development. The baseline files for SIMP are kept and maintained in a git repository. Files are packaged and a series of auto tests are performed on each release. Once released, there is a version number associated for distribution. Additionally, custom puppet modules are in the form of RPMs and have version numbers associated with them. All documentation is also built with source code.

     - a. SIMP provides a minimal list of packages and services installed. The minimal list of packages can be found in kickstart files and the appendix of this document. Additional packages are installed by each implementation or as SIMP modules are applied. b. It's not feasible to technically deny additional applications from being installed. There is nothing in SIMP that can stop and RPM from being applied. Applications that require network access to service activation must be registered with puppet.

     - Configuration changes in SIMP are automated using a combination of puppet, yum, and rsync. While not all files on an operating system are managed by those mechanisms, many are. Changes to critical files that are managed by puppet, revert back to their original state. These mechanisms were not meant to defeat an attack by a malicious insider.

     - Puppet is not intended to be a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized changes to files. For files that are managed by puppet that changed, they will revert back to their original state. This control is really about protecting from unauthorized changes so access control to the puppet master should suffice to meet it. Changes to files are audited using auditd. Puppet changes are also audited. It's up to the implementation to perform altering on those changes.

     - Applications can be installed, but new services will not run unless first registered with puppet. Additionally, puppet modules must be modified to ensure that IPtables opens up the necessary services. Minimally, for a service to remain active, it must be registered with puppet or the svckill.rb script will stop them.To be clear, there is nothing in SIMP that prevents the installation of RPMs (from the command line or YUM).

     - System and Information Integrity
     - Patches that are part of the software base for SIMP are tested within the development environment. There is automated testing that is constantly being extended to test more features. There are times that patches to the base operating system (Centos or RedHat) are needed to resolve issues in SIMP. Those are also tested at build time, but require additional testing by implementations as patches are released from vendors. It's also important to note that SIMP is packaged and delivered decoupled with the operating system source files. It's up to the implementation to test vendor specific patches that are not part of the SIMP code base. Flaws are tracked using the software project management tool Redmine.

     - SIMP uses the yellowdog update manager (YUM) to deliver software patches to clients. Each installation usually has at least one YUM repository. There is also a cronjob running that runs once per day. It's the responsibility of the implementation to get patches to the yum server. Once they are there, the cron job will perform a yum update and the patches will be applied.

     - SIMP has modules available for mcafee and ClamAV. The ClamAV. Implementations need need to provide their own version of the mcafee software for the module to work. That module comes with the ability to sync dat updates to clients via rsync. The modulde does NOT specify how often and what files systems should be scanned. SIMP also implements the open source tool chkrootkit that comes installed by default.

     - The only part of the control (a) that is met by SIMP, is the tracking of security alerts for products that are part of the code base. The development team subscribes to message boards for the main products (puppet) that are part of the packaging. RedHat/Centos advisories are also tracked out of necessity but since ALL the OS files are not part of SIMP delivery, patches are not our direct responsibility.

     - The SIMP team performs a variety of security testing as part of the development process. Compliance and configuration checking is done using SSG. SIMP makes every effort to address problems discovered by these tools. Some configuration settings will not align with tools since the product was meant to be used for operational settings where some security features cause a loss in functionality. Implementations have the option of further hardening their system further at the risk of losing some functionality.
